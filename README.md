# All About JavaScript

JavaScript is a dynamic, weakly-typed, and single-threaded language, compiled at runtime. Widely used for both client-side and server-side development, it is known for its flexibility and powerful ecosystem.

## üß† How JavaScript Works

JavaScript code is processed by a JavaScript Engine which operates in three main steps:

Parsing - Reads and understands the code.
Compilation - Converts the code into machine code.
Execution - Runs the machine code to produce output.

**_ üìù Including JavaScript in HTML _**
There are several ways to include JavaScript within an HTML file:

1. Inline JavaScript
   Write JavaScript code directly inside <script> tags in the <head> section:

<head>
  <script>
    alert("This Works!");
  </script>
</head>

2. External JavaScript
   Use the src attribute of the <script> tag to link to an external JavaScript file:

<script src="assets/scripts/app.js"></script>

Note: Placing this script in the <head> section can block the rendering of the page until the script finishes executing.

3. Deferred Loading (Recommended)
   To avoid blocking page load, place the <script> tag just before the closing </body> tag. This allows the script to load after all HTML content has been rendered:

<body>
  <!-- HTML content -->
  <script src="assets/scripts/app.js"></script>
</body>

### üì¶ Variables in JavaScript

Variables are containers used to store data values. JavaScript supports multiple ways to define variables:

- let
  The let keyword declares a variable whose value can be changed.

let username = "Shashi";
username = "Shashidhar"; // Reassignment is allowed
const
The const keyword declares a variable with a fixed value that cannot be changed.

const age = 24;
// age = 25; // This would throw an error since `age` is a constant

- Naming Conventions
  Use meaningful names for variables.
  Follow camelCase for readability (e.g., userName, totalScore).
  Avoid starting variable names with numbers or special characters.

### üîß Operators in JavaScript

Operators are symbols or keywords that perform operations on values. JavaScript includes several types of operators:

Arithmetic Operators
Perform mathematical operations.

Operator Example Description

- 5 + 3 Addition

- 5 - 3 Subtraction

- 5 \* 3 Multiplication

- / 5 / 3 Division

- % 5 % 3 Modulus (remainder)
- ** 5 ** 3 Exponentiation (power)

**_ Assignment Operators _**
Assign values to variables.

let count = 10;
count += 5; // Equivalent to count = count + 5
Comparison Operators
Compare two values and return a Boolean (true or false).

Operator Example Description

- == 5 == '5' Equality (loose comparison)
- === 5 === '5' Strict equality (value & type)
- != 5 != '5' Inequality
- !== 5 !== '5' Strict inequality
- < 5 < 3 Less than

>     5 > 3	Greater than
>
> <= 5 <= 3 Less than or equal to
> = 5 >= 3 Greater than or equal to
> Logical Operators
> Combine or negate Boolean expressions.

Operator Description Example
&& Logical AND (age >= 18 && age < 65)
`		`
! Logical NOT !(isLoggedIn)
‚ö°Ô∏è Additional Notes
Weak Typing: JavaScript is weakly typed, meaning variable types are determined at runtime. It allows implicit type conversions, which can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior.
Dynamic Nature: JavaScript is dynamic, so variables can be reassigned to values of different types without explicit declarations.

### üìä Data Types in JavaScript

JavaScript provides several fundamental data types that you can use to store and manipulate different kinds of data. Here are some of the primary ones:

- Numbers
  The Number data type is used for both integer and floating-point values.

let age = 25; // Integer
let price = 19.99; // Floating-point number

- Strings
  The String data type is used to represent text. Strings can be defined using single quotes ('...'), double quotes ("..."), or backticks (`...`).

> let greeting = 'Hello';
> let name = "Shashi";
> let message = `Welcome, ${name}!`; // Template literals (using backticks)
> Tip: Use backticks (`...`) for template literals when you need to include variables or expressions >directly within the string using ${...} syntax.

### Functions

- Functions makes interactibility
- we have to define a function & then to execute it, we have to call the function
- function can takes parametes & may not.
Ex : function addNumbers(num1, num2){
    const result = num1 + num2
}

addNumbers(2,3)

- some functions returns the values
ex : function addNumbers(num1, num2){
    const result = num1 + num2
}

const value = addNumbers(2,3)
